        <h3>Patient Forms</h3>

        <p>For your convenience, we have made our patient forms available online.
            We invite you to complete them before your appointment with Fortino Dental.
            As a patient-focused practice, we find that completing your paperwork in advance gives us more time to focus on you and your dental needs.
            If you have questions or need assistance, or to make your appointment with our our office, please contact us at 905-304-1000. Thank you.

        <h3>Financial and Insurance Information</h3>

        <p>Our office works with many different insurance companies.
            Some companies offer many different dental plans.
            Coverage and deductibles can often change when a plan is renewed.
            We are happy to help you in any way that we can to give the insurance company the information they require to provide you with accurate coverage estimates.
        </p>

        <p>Some dental insurance policies are limited and will only pay for a portion of the treatment that may need to be done.
            We ask that you keep us informed if your insurance company or information changes.
            It is very important that we have the most current information about you and your insurance.
        </p>

        <p>As a courtesy to our patients with dental benefit plans, we will print necessary claim forms, receipts, and other information for you to send to your insurance company.
            If your insurance coverage allows electronic filing, we will do that for you.
            The insurance companies reimburse our patient directly, they do not pay us.
        </p>

        <p>For your convenience, payments may be made with cash, personal cheques, Visa, Mastercard or Interac.
            If you have any problems or questions, please ask our staff to help you with your decision to invest in your dental health.
        </p>

        <p>Payment for implant treatment is due the day treatment is rendered.
            If other payment options are required, please contact our office and we will be happy to discuss other options with you.
        </p>

        <h3>Scheduling</h3>

        <p>We will schedule your appointment as promptly as possible.
            Please allow 30-45 minutes for your initial visit.
            We reserve your time just for you, and we try to stay on schedule to minimize your waiting time.
            The referral of emergency patients can cause delays in our schedule, and we appreciate your understanding and patience.
