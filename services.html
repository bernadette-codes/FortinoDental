                <p>Conservative dentistry preserves the teeth in the mouth as much as possible.
                    Conservative dentists performing procedures to remove damaged or diseased tissue attempt to limit the amount of healthy tooth removed, and focus on procedures that will conserve the teeth when it is a viable option.
                    Extractions may still be considered if a patientâ€™s tooth is too badly damaged to save.
                    Services like braces, teeth whitening, and regular cleanings are important to helping conserve your smile and part of our approach.
                </p>

        <p>In this approach to dental health, practitioners, like Dr. Fortino, carefully evaluate dental problems to determine the extent of any issues and develop a plan to treat.
            His goal is to maintain the integrity of the tooth while successfully treating the problem and preventing any recurrences.
        </p>

        <p>Part of conservative dentistry, as in other fields of this health care profession, is preventative care.
            Dr. Fortino regularly inspects his patients for signs of dental disease, recommends cleanings to keep the surface of the teeth clean, and will provide advice on reducing the risk of gum disease.
