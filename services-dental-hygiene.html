                <h2>Dental Hygiene (Cleanings)</h2>

                <p>The best possible way to avoid dental problems such as cavities, gum disease, dental pain and other emergencies is to prevent them in the first place.
                    A great at-home oral hygiene routine, plus visits to see your dentist for regular check-ups and dental cleanings every 4-6 months is an unbeatable combination in prevention.
                </p>

                <p>Dental cleanings usually go hand in hand with a comprehensive oral exam or a regular (recall) exam.
                    Once the exam has been completed, the hygienist will perform a cleaning.
                    For individuals with diagnosed Periodontal gum disease, we recommend a deep cleaning to treat the issue and allow your mouth to heal.
                </p>

            </div>
        </div>

        <p>During the cleaning, the hygienist will use a scaler to remove debris, calculus, and plaque from between your teeth and around your gum line.
            If you need a break or experience any sensitivity, please let us know so we can adjust settings to make you more comfortable.
            We will finish with a polishing using a special paste, and will polish each tooth one by one.
            Afterwards, we will floss your teeth using dental floss, and may make recommendations or suggestions about proper flossing technique.
        </p>

        <p>That’s all there is to it! Once your cleaning is done we will follow up with you about any treatment that may be needed and make any necessary follow up appointments.
        </p>

                <h3>Cleanings for Children</h3>

                <p>We recommend that parents bring their children for oral exams and cleanings beginning at 2-3 years old or sooner if any concerns are noted.
                    Bringing your child early and regularly is an important way to establish your child’s confidence and comfort during regular dental visits, and create a positive relationship with the dentist and staff.
