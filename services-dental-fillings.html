                <h2>Dental Fillings</h2>

                <p>Dental fillings are a treatment option to help restore the function and appearance of a tooth that is damaged or decayed.
                    Dental fillings are most commonly used to treat a cavity.
                    Having a tooth “filled” is a very common procedure and can be completed in one appointment at the office.
                    We are an amalgam-free office and use Composite, or white/tooth-colored material.

        <h3>Dental Fillings for Children</h3>

        <p>Primary, or baby teeth, are generally softer and more porous than adult (permanent) teeth.
            This can make them more susceptible to decay and dental cavities.
            The dental filling procedure and recovery process for children is very similar to that of adults.
            Baby teeth are very important in the development of a child and help preserve the proper space for adult teeth.
            We will attempt to save baby teeth by filling cavities on them rather then taking them out if possible.
        </p>

                <h3>What are the steps involved in a dental filling?</h3>

                <p>First, the dentist will numb the area to be treated with a local anesthetic.
                    Then, he will prepare the tooth by removing the decayed portion of the tooth, or existing restorative materials.
                    The size of the dental filling, or the number of tooth surfaces requiring treatment, will depend on the tooth as well as the extent of the damage or decay.
                </p>

                <p>Once the tooth has been prepared and cleaned, the dentist will fill in the missing portion of the tooth structure with composite restorative material.
                    The dentist will shape the material to match as closely as possible to the former tooth structure.
                    The dentist may ask you to bite down to make sure your teeth fit together comfortably.
                    The dentist will adjust the shape of the filling until it is comfortable for you.
                </p>
